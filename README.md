| **Program replaces 1 with "Boop!"** | User input: "1" | Output: "Boop!" |
| **Program replaces 3 with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."** | User input: "3" | Output: "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that." |
| **Program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the chosen number.** | User input: "5" | Output: "Beep!, Boop!, 2, I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that, 4, 5" |
